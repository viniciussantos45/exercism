# Exercism Solutions

All solutions that I use to learn specific programming languages on [Exercism](https://exercism.org).

## About

This repository contains my personal journey through various programming language tracks on Exercism. Each solution represents my learning process and understanding of different programming concepts, paradigms, and language-specific features.

## What is Exercism?

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a free platform designed to help you improve your coding skills through practice and mentorship. It offers:

- 🎯 **Practice exercises** in over 60 programming languages
- 👥 **Mentorship** from experienced developers
- 🏆 **Learning tracks** structured to build skills progressively
- 💡 **Community discussions** and solution sharing

## Repository Structure

└── README.md
```

Each programming language will have its own directory containing:
- Individual exercise solutions
- Test files (when applicable)
- Exercise-specific documentation

## Programming Languages

This repository will include solutions for various programming languages as I progress through different tracks:

- [ ] **Python** - Object-oriented and functional programming
- [ ] **JavaScript** - Web development and modern JS features
- [ ] **Rust** - Systems programming and memory safety
- [ ] **Go** - Concurrent programming and simplicity
- [ ] **Java** - Enterprise development and OOP principles
- [ ] **C++** - Performance-critical applications
- [ ] **Haskell** - Functional programming paradigms
- [ ] **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development

*Note: This list will be updated as I start new language tracks.*

## Getting Started with Exercism

If you're interested in starting your own Exercism journey:

1. **Sign up** at [exercism.org](https://exercism.org)
2. **Choose a track** based on the language you want to learn
3. **Install the CLI** for easy solution submission
4. **Start solving** exercises and requesting mentorship

### Exercism CLI Setup

```bash
# Download and install the Exercism CLI
# Visit: https://exercism.org/cli-walkthrough

# Configure with your API token
exercism configure --token=your-api-token

# Download an exercise
exercism download --exercise=hello-world --track=python

# Submit your solution
exercism submit solution.py
```

## Learning Approach

My approach to solving exercises:

1. **Read carefully** - Understand the problem requirements
2. **Plan the solution** - Think about the algorithm and approach
3. **Implement** - Write clean, readable code
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all test cases pass
5. **Refactor** - Improve code quality and efficiency
6. **Learn from mentors** - Apply feedback and suggestions
7. **Explore alternatives** - Review community solutions for different approaches
